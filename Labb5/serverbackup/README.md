# Serverbackup #
This is exercise 6 on lab 5 which is about writing a backup script for your server.
For this exercise I've chosen to make a backup script for Proxmox, ie take all the backup files
(vzdump-openvz-111-2013i\_11\_19-08\_20\_20.tar.lzo and so on) and copy them to a tape device and an external harddrive.
